# Hello, internet weirdos

Hi, I'm Chris, I'm a front-end developer working mainly with Javascript and Angular, and I have a master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction, which means I'm _fully_ qualified to fix your broken printer. ðŸ–¨ðŸ—²

I'm currently doing an internship at [ITS4U](https://www.its4u.lu) as a fullstack developer, working on _Angular, Java, Hibernate, MariaDB_.

I like watching dumb videos on Youtube, and when I don't do that, I share fresh dank memes on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrkelisi).
