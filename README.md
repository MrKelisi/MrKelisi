# Hello, internet!

Hi, I'm Chris, I'm a front-end web developer working mainly with TypeScript and Angular, and I have a master's degree in Human-Computer Interaction, which means I'm _fully_ qualified to fix your broken printer. ðŸ–¨ðŸ—²

I'm currently working for [My-Saam](https://www.my-saam.com) as a fullstack developer and tech support, working with technologies like _Angular, Java EE, Hibernate and OpenShift_, just to name a few.

I like watching dumb videos on Youtube, and when I don't do that, I share fresh dank memes on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/mrkelisi).
